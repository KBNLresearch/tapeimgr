# tapeimgr

## Dependencies

Tapeimgr is currently only available on Linux (but you would probably have a hard time setting up a tape drive on Windows to begin with). It wraps around the *dd* and *mt* tools, which are expected to be installed on the system. It requires Python 3.2 or more recent, and *tkinter*. If *tkinter* is not installed already, you need to install it with operating system's package manager (there is no PyInstaller package for *tkinter*). If you're using *apt* this should work:

    sudo apt-get install python3-tk

## Installation

Desktop launcher: Mark as Trusted
